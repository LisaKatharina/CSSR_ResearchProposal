Any feedback, comments, and ideas are encouraged. Please send them to <a href="mailto:c.cosler@mpp.hertie-school.org">Christopher Cosler</a> or <a href="mailto:lisa.schmid@mpp.hertie-school.org">Lisa Schmid</a> or submit a pull request.


## Instructions and background information on our repository:

This repository contains the files of our research proposal for the course "Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis", taught by Christopher Gandrud at the Hertie School of Governance in Fall 2015.

In addition to the Readme file, our repository contains one BibTeX file, an RMD file, a PDF file and an HTML file. The PDF and the HTML were created using the knit function of R Studio. The referenced literature can be found in the BibTeX file "Literature.bib". The R Packages used for the proposal are cited in the BibTeX file "Packages.bib". As the BibTeX files and the RMD file are dynamically linked, it is important to save all three files in the same folder when trying to run the RMD file.

The focus of our research is the identification of the determinants of voluntary organizations to assist refugees. Unfortunately not all the literature utilized for this research can be publicly accessed. Furthermore, clarification of some key concepts is provided via hyperlinks.

We plan on using data from the <a href="https://www.destatis.de/EN/Homepage.html">German Statistical Office</a> and the <a href="http://www.proasyl.de/de/ueber-uns/foerderverein/mitmachen/">customized Google Map maintained by ProAsyl</a>. No authorization is required to access any of these sources. 

Our proposal follows the following strucutre:
Introduction
Theory and Literature Review
Data
Analysis
Limitations
Bibliography
Appendix

## Task for the assignment

The task for this assignment was to write a research proposal that:

States the research question and justifies why it is interesting.
Includes a basic literature review (properly cited with BibTeX).
Identifies data sources and appropriate research methodologies for answering the research question.

The focus of the research proposal should be
- clearly identify and cite your intended data sources
- describe what format the data is currently in and how we intend to clean it up so that it is usable for statistical analysis
- given our data and research question, what types of descriptive and inferential statistics are appropriate and feasible for us to answer our question (be as specific as possible including possibly looking up R functions and packages that implement these statistics).

Deadline for submission:  23th October 2015
